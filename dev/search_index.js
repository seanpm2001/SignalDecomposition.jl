If a given frequency is not exactly matching the Fourier frequencies, the closest one is removed.\n\nImportant: periods/frequencies are defined with respect to the t axis length, the actual t values are not used in this method. So, frequency 1/12 (a period of 12) means 12 data points (whose actual value depends on t).\n\nIf you provide s the method plans the forward and inverse Fourier transforms (so that it is efficient to re-use it for s of same type and length).\n\nThis method works well when a periodic signal P is superimposed on fluctuations S, and you have a good educated guess of what frequencies compose P. This method works well if the given signal has length multiple of the periods given.\n\nThere is arbitrarity of which part of the signal x, r gets the mean value of s, because it is deducted for a better fit. The argument x=true attributes it to x, use false for r.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#SignalDecomposition.FrequencySplit","page":"Documentation","title":"SignalDecomposition.FrequencySplit","text":"FrequencySplit([s, ] f::Real) <: Decomposition\n\nSimilar to the Fourier method, but now the \"residual\" signal is the part of s with frequencies higher than f, while the \"seasonal\" part has frequencies ≤ f.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#SignalDecomposition.Sinusoidal","page":"Documentation","title":"SignalDecomposition.Sinusoidal","text":"Sinusoidal(fs)\n\nDecompose a timeseries s into a sum x + r, where x are sinusoidal components with the given frequencies fs that minimize coefficients A phi of the expression\n\ns approx A_0 + sum_i A_i cos(2pi f_i t + phi_i)\n\nwith bars the mean.\n\nThis method uses a new least-squares algorithm in frequency domain using the package LPVSpectral.jl, see[Bagge2017]. It works for non-equispaced t axis (and also normal), is generally very accurate (if choosen frequencies are not too close), but has performance scaling of O(N^2.4) instead of O(n log(n)) of Fourier.\n\nBecause it can work with arbitrary signal length the method always estimates the zero-frequency Fourier component, and attributes it to x. The fitted coefficients A phi are available as fields .A and .φ of the struct (first entry is zero-frequency component, i.e. the mean with respect to the sinusoidals).\n\n[Bagge2017]: F.

In short, we estimate r by minimizing a cost with two components: that x is close to s/r and that x is smooth. μ is the multiplier of the smoothness cost.\n\nYou can give a vector as μ.
